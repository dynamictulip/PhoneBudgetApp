To switch to the UI thread in a cross-platform fashion, you can use ____________.


19.
An Android application is a collection of collaborating parts called _______.


27.
In order to compile a Xamarin.Forms XAML file into Intermediate Language (IL), you need to _________.

32.
True or False: An iOS application can have more than one UIWindow associated with them.


35.
When working with the Apple iOS Simulator, which of the following statements is false?


36.
True of False: The iOS file system is case-sensitive.


44.
When designing pages in iOS, you can use Auto Layout with... (Select all that apply)


46.
In Xamarin.Forms, a ResourceDictionary stores Key/Value pairs. They type of the Key is string. What is the type of the Value?


52.
True or False: In Xamarin.Forms, StaticResource lookup starts at the Page level.


55.
True or False: In Xamarin.Forms data binding, the Target property can be any public property.


56.
Which of the following is an advantage of data binding:


57.
In Xamarin.Forms, what three pieces of information are required for a Binding?


59.
True or False: In Xamarin.Forms, the Mode property on every Binding always defaults to OneWay.

In Xamarin.Forms, what happens if the value you are binding to does not exist?

Suppose you are using the MVVM pattern with Xamarin.Forms to build an "instant messaging" app. You record a timestamp for when each message was sent or received in a DateTime object. When you display these dates, you have a UI requirement to display only the month and day if the DateTime is within the current year, but display the full date if it is not. According to best practice guidelines for MVVM, where would you put the code to format the DateTime objects into the correct string for display?


83.
Suppose you are using the MVVM pattern with Xamarin.Forms. You would like to use Commands instead of event handlers. How can you determine if the control you are working with supports the Command pattern?


85.
In the Xamarin Designer for iOS, what constraint types are available?


86.
Which code fragment(s) would launch an AboutActivity in Android (select all that apply):

129.
In Xamarin.Forms, suppose you are coding a custom Effect. On each platform you wish to support, you need to declare the Effect identifier. How do you do this?

var iOSButton = UIKit.UIButton.FromType(UIButtonType.System);
var xfView = new Xamarin.Forms.ContentView();
xfView.Content = iOSButton;


131.
True or False: The following code will compile if placed in the iOS head-project of a Xamarin.Forms application (assume any needed using statements are available).
var iOSButton = UIKit.UIButton.FromType(UIButtonType.System);
var xfView = new Xamarin.Forms.ContentView();
xfView.Content = iOSButton.ToView();
